This is the text adventure from my YouTube video.

This adventure was written in 1982 and is the sequel to The Domes of Kilgari text adventure, although it is not really necessary to have played the earlier adventure in order to play this one.

Enjoy.  You can either copy this to a diskette or just drag and drop to the trs80gp emulator running as a TRS-80 Model 1 and it will immediately run.

If you get stuck you can reach out to my on my YouTube channel for hints (https://youtube.com/@alexsrepairbench).
